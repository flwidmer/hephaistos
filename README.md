Simple SQL Generation

== What is this?

This is a hobby project, I want to have a "fluent" interface to write sql statements. I sometimes need to generate large amounts of statements out of Excel files. Maybe this will help me do it faster. Yes, I know about generating a sql statement using Excel formulas, it is not always the right choice.

== Why are you not using JOOQ?

I want this to be a learning experience, so I did intentionally not look at JOOQ and similar libraries.
